# Getting Started
Install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
Open VSCode and install the `tabletopsimulator-lua` extension.
Start Tabletop Simulator, start a single player space and load the Stellar Horizons mod.
Inside VSCode, press CTRL-ALT-L to load the scripts from the TTS instance.
From the workspace that was created, choose "Add Folder to Workspace", and browse to the folder you cloned the repo to.  The name of the repo matches the required imports, so just select your repo folder.
When you press CTRL-ALT-S now, VSCode should connect and upload your scripts that you are editing.
